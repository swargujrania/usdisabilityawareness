          People with disabilities form a smaller portion, about 9%, of the agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining
          industry, which could be because of the physically intensive nature of the work involved.

          However, the lowest number of people with disability actually work in the information industry, accounting for

          Additionally, this data only represents those people who are employed and overall, less than 5% of them are
          disabled. However, 13% of the population of the US are disabled.
